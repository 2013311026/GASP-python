# YAML input file for Python GASP

# defines the composition or region of composition space to search, as a list of dictionaries of element symbol - amount pairs. Each dictionary is a composition
# after parsing this, we need to have some sort of check to make sure the endpoints are valid
# also, based on this, determine whether we are doing a phase diagram search or not (so we know which objective funtion to use)
CompositionSpace:
     - Al
     - Cu
    
    # - Al2O3

# The parameters for making the initial population. For epa searches, the entire block is optional and if not specified, makes 28 random organisms. 
# For pd searches, it is not optional, and structures at each endpoint of the composition space must be provided with the "from_files" flag. Generally, some random structures should also be made.
InitialPopulation:
     from_files:
          path_to_folder: /Users/benjaminrevard/testing/gaspy_testing/Al_Cu_ref_states   # path to directory containing the poscar files. Structures are unpadded in the mainloop, so they can be padded in the files

                     #                                random - no volume scaling - the volume is just the result of the random lattice vectors
